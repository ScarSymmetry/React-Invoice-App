## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- SCSS-modules.
- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com)
- [redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org)
- [framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- redux-persist



### What I learned

Tried the new way of writing redux logic with immer under the hood. 

### Continued development

Haven`t finished mount/unmount animations with framer-motion yet. Also there is a small problem with the date and Yup not validating properly. Flashing theme on reload is annoying.
